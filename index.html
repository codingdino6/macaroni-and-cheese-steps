        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <h2> Step 1: Cook The Pasta</h2>
        <h3> Cook the elbow macaroni in a large pot of salted 
            boiling water according to the package 
            instructions (usually 8-10 minutes), until al dente. Drain and set aside.

        <h2>Step 2: Make the Cheese Sauce</h2>
        <h3>1. In the same pot, melt 3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.<br>
            2. Once the butter has melted, add 3 tablespoons of flour to make a roux. Stir constantly for about 1-2 minutes, until the mixture is lightly golden (this will help thicken your sauce).<br>
            3. Gradually add the 2 cups of whole milk, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Keep whisking until the sauce thickens, which should take about 3-4 minutes.<br>
            4. Season the sauce: Stir in the 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp Dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp smoked paprika. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.

        <h2>Step 3: Add the Cheese</h2>
        <h3>
            Lower the heat to low and stir in the 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese 
            and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Stir until the cheese is fully melted 
            and the sauce is smooth.</h3>

        <h2> Step 4: Combine the Pasta and the Sauce</h2>
        <h3> 1. Add the cooked macaroni to the sauce and stir to combine, 
            ensuring all the pasta is coated with the cheesy sauce. 
            Remove from heat.</h3>

        <h2> Step 5: Make the Breadcrumb Topping</h2>
        <h3>
            1.Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).<br>
            2. In a small skillet, melt a little butter or heat a small amount of oil over medium heat.<br>
            3. Toast the breadcrumbs for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, 
            until they are golden brown and crispy. <br>You can add a pinch of salt 
            or a dash of smoked paprika to enhance the flavor of the topping, if desired.

        <h2> Step 6: Assemble and Bake(optional)</h2>
        <h3> 1. If you'd like a crispy baked topping, transfer the mac and cheese to a baking dish (like an 8x8 or similar size).<br>
            2. Sprinkle the toasted breadcrumbs evenly over the top of the mac and cheese.<br>
            3. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and crispy.</h3>
